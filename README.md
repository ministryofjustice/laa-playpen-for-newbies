*I placed 'this' private repo in MOJ GitHub as place where people can play whilst getting used to GitHub. 
Learn in a safe place without every body creating new Private repos (as its a charged thing - I think) = GjLing 21/6/2017*


This is what works for me (Gavin):
Development of Microservices using Java and Springboot framework.
Its a lot less hassle to use your own kit than using MOJ laptops which are locked down, slow and just too small (at the time of writting). and no correct tooling installed.
My own personal Mac & PC have a lot of tools installed to make my life easier - 
- Git client (https://git-scm.com/download/win). 
- GitHub Desktop Client application to play with if I want.

I suggest that you learn the command line client first I also think you should adopt the Unix for Windows, also as it makes life easier in the long run. Unix rocks - PCDOS sucks simple as.



### Check if you've got GIT installed

drop to a terminal window and type:

```
git --version
```

No? (PC user)- install the 'Git' from the above link - take the install defaults. You have 'Git'. 
But you've also got the Unix emulator 'Git Bash', a 'Born Again SHell' where you can think/type in Unix - on a PC :-)

i.e.
```
ls -l c:/data/GitHub
cd c:/data/GitHub
touch abc.txt
vi abc.txt
```
but the Bash shell can access other tools on your PC - type 
```
git --version
java -version
mvn -version
```
